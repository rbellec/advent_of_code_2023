# AdventOfCode2023

I had a love story with Erlang younger and wanted to get back to it. Of course ~we~ I were young and once I grew up and listened to everyone else telling me that Erlang is not a good language for anything, I tries to forget about it. Then Elixir came and doing an AoC in Elixir is a good way to mix fun with a language and fun with AoC (and maybe some learning).

Other goals for this AoC:

- Use an optic libs
- Use Parsec
- Maybe use libgraph
- Test some visualisation in Elixir ?
