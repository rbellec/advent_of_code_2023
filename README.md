# AdventOfCode2023

Note :
- before day 8 I left some commented breakpoints in case someone wants to run the code and see the result of the day.
- After day 8 I'll voluntarily leave commented breakpoints in places where, I think, it can help someone else understand what is happening if they want to play with the code.

I had a love story with Erlang younger and wanted to get back to it. Of course ~we~ I were young and once I grew up and listened to everyone else telling me that Erlang is not a good language for anything, I tried to forget about it. Then it came back dressed as a Ruby and... Yes I felt.

Since I am doing this AoC in Elixir to learn, I hapilly take feedback.

# How to run

There are unit tests (sometimes commented because I limit my time for AoC). You can run them with `mix test`

You can also run any day with `mix dayX` where X is the day number, like in `mix day01`. Place your input in `inputs/dayX.txt` before.

# References
I read first days of Ryan Bates' last year Elixir repo last month to decide if it was a good idea to use Elixir this year. It's beautiful ! You should have a look: https://github.com/ryanb/advent-2022

# Personals goals for this AoC:

- Use an optic libs -> done
- Use Parsec -> done and I love it more and more
- look at Macros and metaprogramming
- Maybe use libgraph
- Test some visualisation in Elixir ?
- Not use concurency just because I can. (unless it's fun of course !)
