I had a love story with Erlang younger and wanted to get back to it. Of course ~we~ I were young and once I grew up and listened to everyone else telling me that Erlang is not a good language for anything, I tries to forget about it. Then Elixir came and doing an AoC in Elixir is a good way to mix fun with a language and fun with AoC (and maybe some learning).

About libs, did I try to use some tools before I even looked at the first problem ?
You guessed ! I saw there war a Optics lib in Elixir found it very interesting in Haskell. Not sure I will use deeply nested structures.
